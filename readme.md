# Project 5: Sovereign Engine 🇿🇦
### Strategic Advisory & Capital Allocation Intelligence

## 📌 Executive Summary
The **Sovereign Engine** is a deterministic decision-intelligence tool designed for CFOs and Executive Leadership. It bridges the gap between raw financial data and strategic action by synthesizing macro-economic signals, statutory tax obligations (SARS 27%), and risk-adjusted capital allocation models.

## 🛠 Strategic Features
* **Multi-Layer Ledger Processing:** Automates the pipeline from raw GL data to consolidated financial statements.
* **ZAR Statutory Compliance:** Integrated South African corporate tax logic (27%) and liquidity monitoring.
* **Risk Signal Synthesis:** Uses modern Python dataclasses to weight macroeconomic tightening, business resilience, and geopolitical exposure.
* **Capital Allocation Engine:** Employs a risk-adjustment factor to provide dynamic guidance on Growth Investment vs. Defensive Reserves.

## 📊 Technical Architecture
The engine is built on a modular, 5-layer architecture:
1.  **Layer 1:** Core Ledger Generation.
2.  **Layer 2:** Audit Controls & Validation.
3.  **Layer 3:** KPI & Tax Provisioning.
4.  **Layer 4:** Strategic Simulation & Logic.
5.  **Final Engine:** Executive Advisory Reporting.
